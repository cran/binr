Title: Cut Numeric Values into Evenly Distributed Groups
Version: 1.1.1
Author: Sergei Izrailev
Maintainer: Sergei Izrailev <sizrailev@jabiruventures.com>
Description: Implementation of algorithms for cutting numerical values
    exhibiting a potentially highly skewed distribution into evenly distributed
    groups (bins). This functionality can be applied for binning discrete
    values, such as counts, as well as for discretization of continuous values,
    for example, during generation of features used in machine learning
    algorithms.
